# Redirect After Login Implementation

This implementation ensures that when a user tries to access a protected page (like booking a service) without being logged in, they are redirected to the login page, and after successful login, they are taken back to the original page they were trying to access.

## How It Works

### 1. User Flow
1. User tries to access a protected page (e.g., `/services/1/bookings/new`)
2. Since they're not logged in, they get redirected to `/users/sign_in`
3. The original URL is stored in the session
4. After successful login, they're redirected back to the original URL

### 2. Implementation Details

#### Application Controller Changes
```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_action :store_user_location!, if: :storable_location?

  protected

  def after_sign_in_path_for(resource)
    # Return to the stored location if available, otherwise use default logic
    stored_location_for(resource) || default_after_sign_in_path_for(resource)
  end

  private

  def storable_location?
    # Only store location for GET requests that are not AJAX requests
    request.get? && !request.xhr? && !devise_controller?
  end

  def store_user_location!
    # Store the current location for redirect after sign in
    store_location_for(:user, request.fullpath)
  end
end
```

### 3. Protected Routes

The following controllers use `authenticate_user!` and will trigger this redirect flow:

- **BookingsController**: When users try to book a service
- **ClientDashboardController**: When users try to access their dashboard
- **ServiceProvidersController**: When service providers try to access their pages
- **PayFastController**: When users try to make payments
- **StripeController**: When users try to make payments

### 4. Testing the Flow

#### Manual Testing
1. Log out of your account
2. Navigate to any service page (e.g., `/services/1`)
3. Click "Book Now"
4. You should be redirected to the login page
5. Log in with your credentials
6. You should be redirected back to the booking page

#### Automated Testing
Run the integration test:
```bash
rails test test/integration/booking_redirect_test.rb
```

### 5. Debug Helper

In development mode, you can add this to any view to see the stored location:
```erb
<%= debug_stored_location %>
```

This will show a yellow banner with the stored location if one exists.

### 6. Customization

#### Adding More Protected Routes
To add more routes that should store the location before redirecting to login:

1. Add `before_action :authenticate_user!` to your controller
2. The redirect flow will automatically work

#### Custom Redirect Logic
If you need custom redirect logic for specific controllers, you can override `after_sign_in_path_for`:

```ruby
class BookingsController < ApplicationController
  def after_sign_in_path_for(resource)
    # Custom logic for bookings
    stored_location_for(resource) || categories_path
  end
end
```

#### Excluding Routes
If you don't want certain routes to store the location, modify the `storable_location?` method:

```ruby
def storable_location?
  request.get? && !request.xhr? && !devise_controller? && 
  !request.path.start_with?('/admin') # Exclude admin routes
end
```

### 7. Troubleshooting

#### User not redirected back to original page?
1. Check that the route is protected with `authenticate_user!`
2. Verify the request is a GET request (not POST/PUT/DELETE)
3. Ensure it's not an AJAX request
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

#### Stored location not working?
1. Check that Devise is properly configured
2. Verify the session is working correctly
3. Check that `store_location_for` is being called
4. Use the debug helper to see if location is being stored

#### Multiple redirects?
1. Ensure `stored_location_for` is being called in `after_sign_in_path_for`
2. Check that the stored location is being cleared after use
3. Verify there are no conflicting redirect logic

### 8. Security Considerations

- Only GET requests store locations (prevents CSRF issues)
- AJAX requests are excluded (prevents XSS issues)
- Devise controller requests are excluded (prevents loops)
- Stored locations are cleared after use

### 9. Browser Compatibility

This implementation works with:
- ✅ All modern browsers
- ✅ Mobile browsers
- ✅ Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
- ✅ Single Page Applications (SPA) with Turbo

The implementation uses Rails' built-in session storage and Devise's location storage, making it compatible with all browsers that support cookies.
